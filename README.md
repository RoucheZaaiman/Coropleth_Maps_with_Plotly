# Choropleth Maps Exercise 

In this exercise I use simple datasets to create Choropleth Maps using fundamental Plotly skills. Due to the Nature of Plotly the visualizations cannot be seen when browsing through the notebook.  However, I include screenshots of the coropleth maps in this repository for a quick view.

In this notebook I create 2 coropleth maps:  The first one is to display the Power Consumption of countries and the second to display the Voting_Age polpulation for the 2012 USA Election.

The exercises were done through Jose Portilla (Head of Data Science at Pierian Data Inc.) on Udemy.

# Coropleth_Maps_with_Plotly
# Choropleth Maps Exercise   In this exercise I use simple datasets to create Choropleth Maps using fundamental Plotly skills. Due to the Nature of Plotly the visualizations cannot be seen when browsing through the notebook.  However, I include screenshots of the coropleth maps in this repository for a quick view.  These exercises were done through Jose Portilla (Head of Data Science at Pierian Data Inc.) on Udemy.
